This is my attempt at creating a steaming website in React @https://streamify-6103a.web.app

#FEATURES: 

The home page has 3 sections containing movies, shows and trending. As the user hovers (at least on computers) on a poster some details
about the movie/show are displayed. The user can then click on the poster to be taken to the movie/show page where details, reviews and related media are displayed.

 The user can also use a searchbar to find specific movies and tv shows.

#ISSUES:

The background image on the details page does not work in the safari browser.
