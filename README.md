This is my attempt at creating a steaming website in React @https://streamify-6103a.web.app

# FEATURES: 

The home page has 3 sections containing movies, shows and trending. As the user hovers (at least on computers) on a poster some details
about the movie/show are displayed. The user can then click on the poster to be taken to the movie/show page where details, reviews and related media are displayed.

 The user can also use a searchbar to find specific movies and TV shows.

 # Implementation:
 The website was made with HTML, CSS, and React. No backend is being used and all the data is received from the TMDB API.

# ISSUES:

- The background image on the details page does not work in the Safari browser.
- Some performance issues when viewing media on the home page.
